            <b>Pokémon</b>[a][b] is a Japanese media franchise consisting of
            video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and
            other related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe
            in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, a large
            variety of species endowed with special powers. The franchise's
            target audience is children aged 5 to 12,[2] but it is known to
            attract people of all ages.[I] The franchise originated as a pair of
            role-playing games developed by Game Freak, from an original concept
            by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on February
            27, 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga
            series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998
            to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an
            unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the
            craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture in popular
            culture, with new products being released to this day. In the summer
            of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of
            Pokémon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic. Pokémon
            has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media
            franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises. Pokémon
            has an uncommon ownership structure.[11] Unlike most IPs, which are
            owned by one company, Pokémon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo,
            Game Freak, and Creatures.[1] Game Freak develops the core series
            role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for
            their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and
            related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The
            three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to
            manage the Pokémon property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series
            and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon
            Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the
            franchise in all regions outside of Asia.[12][13]

            1989–1995: Development of Red & Green
          </h3>
          <p class="hero-text">
            Tajiri started to think of what was to become Pokémon while
            completing Quinty, and before he officially founded Game Freak.
            Around this time, Nintendo announced the upcoming release of the
            Game Boy, a handheld console that would revolutionize the gaming
            industry. Tajiri learned that the device would have a link port, and
            with the corresponding Game Link Cable, two Game Boys could be
            linked together.[68] Sometime later, Tajiri remembered an incident
            while playing Dragon Quest II (1987), a role-playing game (RPG) for
            the Famicom (NES). The game features randomly appearing items of
            varying rarity, including an extremely rare item called Mysterious
            Hat.[e] Tajiri did not encounter any, while Ken Sugimori, who was
            also playing the game, encountered two. Upon recalling this
            experience, Tajiri realized that the cable now made it possible to
            transfer things from one cartridge to another.[IV] He noted that,
            until then, the Game Link Cable was only used for competing, but not
            for something else.[73] Combining this inspiration with his memories
            of catching insects and other small species, Tajiri's idea would
            eventually evolve into a virtual recreation of his boyhood
            experiences,[74] and an attempt to "regain the world that he had
            lost".[75] He would later state that the game represents "the story
            of a boy's summer day".[76]

          <p class="hero-text">
            The Pokémon Trading Card Game (PTCG) was one of the first
            collectable card games (CCGs) in Japan. It was inspired by Magic:
            The Gathering.[145][146][147] In the card game, the players use a
            60-card deck featuring Basic and evolved Pokémon, Energy cards, and
            Trainer cards to help them knock out the opponent's Pokémon, drawing
            prize cards and winning the game.[457] Cards are classified into
            various levels of rarity, ranging from Common to Rare Holofoil with
            a holographic illustration. Rare cards, including limited edition,
            exclusive cards, and older cards, are highly valued among collectors
            due to their scarcity.[458][459] According to the official website
            of The Pokémon Company, 64.8 billion cards have been produced as of
            March 2024.[456]

            Reaction to Pokémania (1999–2000)
          </h3>
          <p class="hero-text">
            In 1999 and 2000, Pokémon was an unprecedented, ubiquitous fad in
            the Western world. Time magazine described it as "a multimedia and
            interactive barrage like no other before it".[25] The franchise,
            primarily aimed at children, elicited mixed responses from parents
            and teachers, some of them critical. Yano (2004) even claimed that
            the reactions at one point constituted a moral panic.[469] The bulk
            of the criticism on Pokémon was directed at the trading cards,[470]
            in particular the booster packs, sealed packages of 11[f] randomly
            inserted cards that were sold separately from the main sets. The
            cards are of varying scarcity, the most valuable being the "holofoil
            cards" (also called "holographic" or "foil cards"), in which the
            illustrations of the Pokémon have a shiny overlay effect. The rare
            cards can only be found in booster packs, and the rarest ones are
            very infrequently included. Tobin (2004) notes that rarity in this
            case is "artificially created", and "effectively a form of gambling"
            in which children need to repeatedly purchase booster packs to get
            more rare cards.[471] Brougère (2004) described a cynicism among
            adults that corporations could apparently, "out of thin air",
            ascribe value to cards which they saw as valueless, thereby
            "deceiving vulnerable young consumers and garnering excessive
            profits".[470] As the franchise's popularity grew, children began
            taking their Pokémon cards to school for trading and playing. Soon,
            the cards were alleged to be "disrupting learning, poisoning
            playground friendships and causing such distraction that some
            children forget their homework, tune out in class and even miss
            school buses as they scramble to acquire one more card".[472] The
            cards were "turning the playground into a black market",[473] with
            card swaps sometimes inciting conflicts. Certain children engaged in
            "aggressive trading",[474] tricking other (often younger) kids into
            unfair deals, forcing teachers to arbitrate.[XI] Some parents
            expressed their concerns about the craze, but feared that their
            children would be ostracized if they were to deny them Pokémon
            products.[474][479][480] In the US, the Pokémon cards ended up
            "almost universally banned" from school grounds.[481] Similar bans
            occurred in Canada,[482][483] Australia,[484] New Zealand,[485] and
            European countries.[474][486][487] In September 1999, US-based law
            firm Milberg filed a class-action lawsuit against Nintendo of
            America, Wizards of the Coast, and 4Kids. The suit claimed that the
            booster packs constitute a form of lottery and promote gambling in
            kids.[488][489] Susan Estrich noted that similar lawsuits had been
            filed against trading-card makers in the US, without success.[490]
            The Pokémon card suit is not known to have gone to court, and is
            believed to have been settled.[j] The Pokémon anime series was
            criticized by some as "cheap Japanese animation"[492] that is
            "violent"[26][493][494] and has "little educational value".[495]
            Michelle Orecklin of Time dismissed the TV series as "less a cartoon
            than a half-hour exercise in Pokémon product placement".[496]
            Allison (2006) wrote that even those within Pokémon's US marketing
            team agreed that the anime's visuals were "not especially
            sophisticated" compared to Disney cartoons.[492] Pokémon: The First
            Movie premiered in the United States on November 12, 1999, and in
            European countries in February 2000. While a huge box-office
            success, the film was received negatively by several Western film
            critics.[497][498] The Guardian decried it as a "contemptuously
            cheap animated cash-in on the monster kids' craze".[499] The
            American adult animated series South Park satirized Pokémon in the
            episode "Chinpokomon", aired on November 3, 1999. In the episode,
            the titular media franchise is portrayed as a low-quality line of
            products that is part of an evil plan by the Japanese government to
            invade the US. South Park co-creator Matt Stone commented that, at
            the time, Pokémon was "scary huge".[500] Kohler (2004) wrote that
            Pokémon was considered "ruthlessly commercial", and that it
            "program[med] children to be consumers of anything and everything
            Pokémon".[501] CNN quoted child psychiatrist John Lochridge as
            worrying that "Pokémon's creators and marketers deliberately set out
            to create a fantasy world so compelling that children would quickly
            become obsessed". He believed that kids were being "brainwashed",
            and said: "I have had parents tell me that they cannot get their
            kids to do anything except Pokémon, so this stuff seems to really
            capture their minds, in a way".[5] These concerns were countered by
            psychologist William Damon, who told Newsweek that obsessing is in
            fact a normal part of a child's neurological development. It should
            concern parents only when the obsession gets dangerous or
            excessive.[502] An op-ed in the New Zealander newspaper The Dominion
            Post claimed that the anti-Pokémon sentiment was particularly
            American: "The backlash, which seems largely confined to the United
            States, may be no more than the sound of the world's leading
            cultural imperialist gagging on a taste of its own medicine".[503]
            As Pokémania built, Western media started reporting on several
            crimes associated with Pokémon. These included violence[484][504]
            (including two reported stabbings),[505][506] burglaries,[507][508]
            robberies[504][509] (some at knifepoint),[510][511] and
            shoplifting.[512][513] Almost all these incidents were connected to
            the Pokémon cards, and the individuals involved were almost always
            underage. In the US, the incidents peaked in November 1999.[321] In
            England, Pokémon-related delinquency reached a head in April
            2000.[510][514] High prices on the grey market were a motive behind
            some of the crimes, "posing a great temptation for older kids and
            bullies to take advantage of weaker children".[515] At specialty
            shops and online auctions, a rare Pokémon card could be bought and
            sold for $50 or more (c. $91 in 2023).[516] Aside from the negative
            reactions, many media also cited alleged beneficial effects of
            Pokémon.[517][518][519] It was noted that the video games and the
            cards require children to read, memorize, calculate, and plan out a
            strategy.[4][162][520] Both encourage socialization, and trading
            Pokémon requires negotiating skills.[5][15][21] Stephanie Strom
            wrote in The New York Times that the Pokémon anime taught children
            "traditional Japanese values -- responsibility, empathy,
            cooperation, obedience, respect for elders, humility".[521] Anne
            Allison interviewed various American parents during Pokémania. She
            found that while most of them were "utterly mystified" about
            Pokémon, few were overly worried about it, instead meeting the craze
            with "befuddled acceptance". Allison also notes that the Columbine
            High School massacre occurred during Pokémania, causing violent
            television, music, and games to be scrutinized. Compared to these
            media, she notes, Pokémon is in fact rather tame.[522] In contrast,
            Pokémon received far less criticism in its native country of Japan.
            Yano (2004) attributes this to cultural differences, which includes:
            1) greater acceptance of exuberant consumerism – to buy is to be a
            good citizen; 2) less focus on media influence – instead, Japan's
            educational system, bullying, and dysfunctional families are more
            often the target of attention; 3) less separation between child- and
            adulthood – what is suitable for adults is not necessarily
            considered unsuitable for kids; 4) Pokémon being permeated with
            kawaisa (cuteness), a hallmark of Japanese culture; 5) Japan's core
            religions, Buddhism and Shinto, are less moralizing in nature.[523]
            However, Oliver Burkeman wrote in The Guardian that the Pokémon
            cards were also banned from some Japanese schools.[28]

          <p class="hero-text">
            After World War II, Japan experienced a period of unprecedented
            growth and became well-known in the Western world for its consumer
            products, such as radios (e.g. Panasonic, Toshiba), cars (e.g.
            Toyota, Mitsubishi), and Sony's Walkman.[524] From 1991 onwards, its
            economy stagnated, causing the country to lose its status as an
            economic superpower. However, during the 1990s and 2000s, Japan
            re-emerged as a source of 'cool' cultural goods, embraced by a
            growing international audience interested in Japanese culture.[XII]
            Nintendo, Sega, and Sony launched several popular video game
            consoles and franchises.[242][529][530] In terms of children's
            properties, the success of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers changed
            perceptions on the viability of such Japanese imports in the
            West.[531][532][533] The Tamagotchi fad (1997–98),[534] centered
            around a portable digital pet device, was said to have "paved the
            way for Pokémon".[241] Anne Allison (2006) wrote that, before the
            1990s, Japan figured little in the face of the worldwide hegemony of
            Euro-American cultural industries, in particular that of the US.
            "Hollywood has been hostile to imports", she wrote, "and foreignness
            has largely been, and been seen as, an impediment to mass
            popularization in the United States".[535] The surprise success of
            Pokémon was "an undeniable breakthrough in the homeland of Disney"
            that "changed preexisting assumptions about the US marketplace at
            the same time that it was constantly resisted for deviating from
            them".[536] Pokémon was a welcomed boon to Japan's faltering
            economy,[211] and positively influenced the country's soft
            power.[537][538] Kamo (2000) interviewed various American children
            and found that kids who thought Pokémon was cool, were more likely
            to believe that Japan was a cool nation.[539] Allison (2003) gave a
            similar finding: all the children she interviewed knew where Pokémon
            originated, and "many said that, as a result of Pokémon and other
            'cool' Japanese goods, they had developed an interest in Japan. A
            number said that they now wanted to study Japanese and travel there
            one day".[540] Kohler (2004) wrote: "Japanese are proud of Pokémon,
            the most successful export of Japanese popular culture ever".[541]
            Although, Iwabuchi (2004) questioned to what extent Pokémon really
            is 'Japanese', and to what extent it is simply a good property with
            universal appeal. He noted that Japanese nationalist commentators
            celebrated Pokémon's global success and retrospectively attributed
            this to its "Japanese cultural power",[542] while ignoring the
            localization of Pokémon overseas,[543] as well as decades of
            increasing cooperation and cultural exchange between countries
            (globalization).[544] In the 20th century, anime found niche
            popularity in North America and Europe in series (Astro Boy, Kimba
            the White Lion, Speed Racer) and films (Akira, Ghost in the
            Shell).[XIII] The Pokémon TV series and films marked a breakthrough
            for anime, contributing to its growing worldwide success at the turn
            of the 21st century.[XIV] For some children, Pokémon was their
            introduction to 'Japanimation',[549][550] serving as a "gateway" to
            other anime, manga, and Japanese culture in general.[551][552]
            Pokémon: The First Movie became one of the most successful Japanese
            animated films in history.[320] After Princess Mononoke, Pokémon:
            The First Movie became the second anime film to open at mainstream
            cinemas in the West, as opposed to the usual art house venues.[553]
            Pioneering anime importer John Ledford noted that Pokémon
            underscored the commercial potential of anime, thus making it
            interesting from a business perspective.[554] In the field of video
            games, the main Pokémon series became the standard within the
            monster-taming game genre, a subtype of RPGs. While not the first to
            use this concept, the Pokémon games became so synonymous with it
            that later titles involving catching and training monsters, of any
            genre, were inevitably compared to Pokémon.[555][556][557] Examples
            of this include Dragon Warrior Monsters (1998),[XV] Robopon Sun and
            Star (1998),[563][564] Spectrobes (2007),[XVI] Invizimals
            (2009),[XVII] Monster Crown (2021),[XVIII] and Palworld (2024).[XIX]
            The success of Pokémon encouraged companies to look for other
            popular Japanese properties that might be localized for Western
            markets.[249][585][586] The importing of at least three similar
            franchises were confirmed by business executives to have been
            (partly) inspired by Pokémon: Yu-Gi-Oh!,[587] Digimon,[588] and
            Monster Rancher.[589] The import of Cardcaptor Sakura (as
            Cardcaptors) might also have been prompted by Pokémon.[590][591]

              "When we started this project in Japan, one of the first things I
              was told was that this kind of thing would never appeal to
              American audiences. They said, 'Because the characters are in a
              very Japanese style, you cannot sell them to Americans'. So from
              the very beginning, I never thought there would be an English
              version. Now, it's just as popular in the United States [as in
              Japan], and I realized that we shouldn't always believe the
              opinions of conservative marketers." Shigeru Miyamoto, August
              1999[237]
